## Problem Statement  
Let’s be honest — most typing practice tools feel like a chore. Plain sentences, boring paragraphs, no personality. People start with good intentions, but after a few minutes they’re already bored and closing the app.  
We wanted to fix that. Why should improving a useful life skill feel like punishment?

## Scope of the Project  
This is a small, friendly, and completely offline Python program that turns typing practice into something you’ll actually smile at. It picks a random funny one-liner joke, asks you to type it exactly, and instantly tells you how fast and accurate you were. No installation hassles, no accounts, no ads — just you, a joke, and your keyboard.

## Target Users  
Pretty much anyone who touches a keyboard and wants to get better without falling asleep:
- Students who have typing tests coming up  
- Office workers who want to stop hunting-and-pecking  
- Programmers who spend all day in code  
- Writers chasing faster drafts  
- Absolute beginners learning touch typing  
- Or literally anyone who just wants to laugh at a dumb joke while improving a skill

## High-Level Features  
- 30 hand-picked, genuinely funny jokes (no boring “The quick brown fox…” nonsense)  
- Starts and stops the timer the moment you press Enter  
- Shows your speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) the same way professional tests do  
- Tells you exactly how accurate you were, right down to every capital letter and apostrophe  
- Gives you a fun little compliment (or gentle nudge) based on your score  
- Lets you try again as many times as you want — no limits, no judgment  
- Clean, cheerful layout that feels more like a game than a test  

Because practicing should feel like play, not work.
